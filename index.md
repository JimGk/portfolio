# üëã Welcome to My Portfolio

üßë‚Äçüíª About Me

I‚Äôm Dimitrios, a creative problem solver with roots in music and a deep passion for automation and analytics. Born in Thessaloniki in December 1993, I studied Ethnomusicology and have been involved in music since the age of 6. My curiosity for computers began early, and over time I‚Äôve combined both logic and creativity in my career journey.

After relocating to Bulgaria in 2019 for a customer support role with Air France and KLM, I rediscovered my love for tech. While working with Amadeus systems, I realized how much I enjoyed working with logic and structure. I soon moved into the content moderation world, progressing from moderator to SME to QA to Business Analyst ‚Äî where I found my true passion: using data to make work easier and more impactful.

My first major challenge as a Business Analyst involved processing massive Excel exports for shift corrections ‚Äî a task Excel simply couldn‚Äôt handle. I turned to Python, teaching myself through trial, error, and AI assistance. The result was a modular set of scripts that automated the entire workflow, reducing processing time from 120 hours to just 6.

Building on that success, I later created a dynamic reporting system to handle 13 markets and 23 KPIs, organizing 5‚Äì6 raw Excel files per market into clean, structured outputs. I introduced a command-line interface to customize breakdowns by Line of Business and market, cutting report time from 6 hours to 30 minutes.

Since then, I‚Äôve also developed tools for Root Cause Analysis (RCA), Excel VBA automations for attendance tracking, and dashboards that provide actionable insights to Operations and QA teams.

I‚Äôm now combining analytical rigor with technical creativity to design smart, scalable tools that solve real problems. Whether in Python, SQL, or Excel, I love creating efficient systems that bring clarity to complexity.
