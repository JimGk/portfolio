# 👋 Welcome to My Portfolio

🧑‍💻 About Me

Hi, I’m Dimitrios — a classically trained musician turned data analyst with a passion for solving problems through automation.

Born in Thessaloniki in December 1993, I studied Ethnomusicology and began working in tech as a teleagent. My curiosity led me from coding in Pascal and Java to mastering Excel and Python through real-world challenges in analytics.

I currently work as a Real-Time Analyst and Business Analyst, building tools and automations that save hundreds of hours every month. My work blends creativity and precision — from transforming massive Excel exports with Python to designing dashboards that help teams make better decisions.
